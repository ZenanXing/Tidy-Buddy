These Excel files are named after the target vector in Golden Gate Assembly.
Each file contains three sheets:
1. Barcoded_Primers: The barcoded primers used for multiplexing during colony PCR. Users can order these primers if they are using the same vector.
2. PrimerPlate_Layout: The suggested usage of the primers listed in the "Barcoded_Primers" sheet. You can mix the primers according to this layout in 96-well plates before performing the colony PCR.
3. TidyFormat: The tidy format of the suggested primers layout with the corresponding barcode and primer information in each well.
